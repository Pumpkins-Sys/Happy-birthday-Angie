I am the blue bird that wanders the earth
I have flown side by side with time
Different kinds of people I have known
Yet none like you
You topple all my preconceived notions of humanity
Never had I ever known a kind soul as you
I flew with time to speed for my final departure-death
Then you came along
And for the first, I don't want to go yet.
No, not yet.
I can't put my finger around it
Every fiber of my being screams:
You are incredible, Angelo. 
You are my matchless poet
You have a way with words that is awe-inspiring
You make poetry seem easy
I know it is.
Yet your smoothness with words is but a dazzling wonder
Angelo, the life-giving poet
I call you that because you woke the dead-me
Your poems and how you write is a breath of life for me
Matchless poet
Life-giving poet
Which is it?
which should I settle for?
I don't know. Both? Yes both
Knowing you is one of the best things in my life
The world has waited for this day,
And now you are here
Our answer,
Our long awaited comet
Happy birthday, dearest friend.</pre

            "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front
            only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it
            had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not

            nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary.
            I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so
            sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to
            cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and
            reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then
            to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness
            to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be
